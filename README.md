# Real_Time_Financial_App

 connect a live data feed to the application, then visualize historical data alongside real-time data using the Perspective library. By doing this, you simulate the experience of developing a dashboard that shows real-time market data and trends, an essential function for financial applications at JPMorgan Chase.

Connect to a Live Data Feed:

Establish a connection to a simulated live data feed provided by JPMorgan Chase's backend (often provided in the repository setup for the task).
Ensure the application can handle incoming data in real time and can process it into a format compatible with Perspective.
Set Up Perspective Table for Historical and Real-Time Data:

Use Perspective to set up a table that can handle both historical and incoming data.
Modify the table settings to append incoming data to the existing table instead of replacing it, allowing you to track historical trends.
Configure Perspective to refresh periodically or update dynamically as new data arrives.
Integrate Historical Data:

Load initial historical data into the Perspective table when the application starts. This data could be either hardcoded for the exercise or fetched from a mock API.
Ensure that the historical data displays correctly and that it transitions smoothly when new live data is appended.
Develop the Visualization Layout:

Set up the visualization to distinguish between historical and live data if required (e.g., using color coding or labeling).
Use line charts or other appropriate visualizations in Perspective to represent the trend over time, with axes clearly marking the timeline and data values.
Implement Data Processing Logic:

Add logic to handle any data transformations or aggregations needed to make the data useful and readable.
Implement error handling for the data feed, ensuring that if there’s an interruption, the application either retries or displays an appropriate error message.
Test the Real-Time Feed and Visualization:

Test the application to make sure the visualization updates seamlessly with new data.
Confirm that the app remains responsive and functional even as data continuously updates.
Document and Refine Code:

Add comments and documentation explaining the live feed integration and data handling logic.
Ensure the app meets all requirements for Task 3, making any adjustments based on performance or feedback.
Key Tools & Skills:
WebSockets (or another real-time protocol, if specified): Understand WebSocket integration if the data feed uses this protocol, as it’s commonly used for live data.
JavaScript and Promises: Manage asynchronous data handling effectively.
Perspective API: Expand on prior knowledge of tables and views to handle historical data and live data simultaneously.
Key Concepts in Perspective:
Streaming Data Integration: You’ll work with continuous data flow, ensuring Perspective renders new data in real time.
Table Updates: The table needs to support incremental updates so historical data is retained while new data is added.
Responsive Visualization: Keep the UI responsive despite the continuous data input.
